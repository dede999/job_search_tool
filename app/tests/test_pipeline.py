"""Sanity test for filters.py + dedup.py, using real sample data plus the
actual noise patterns found in a live run on 2026-08-11 (Remote
Poland/Spain/Australia leaking through, and non-engineering titles like
Analyst/Manager/Marketing passing because the old filter was exclusion-only).

Locations use Brazil/LATAM strings to match the current
filters.yaml location_allow_patterns (retargeted from Canada — see
companies.yaml/filters.yaml history); the filtering behavior under test is
unrelated to which region the allowlist targets.
Run with: python -m app.tests.test_pipeline
