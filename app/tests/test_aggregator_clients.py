"""Sanity test for aggregator_clients.py's full-JD-fetch logic — no real
network calls (this dev sandbox blocks outbound httpx to arbitrary domains
anyway; see the module docstrings). Mocks httpx.get/httpx.Response to
verify: (1) fetch_full_description prefers a recognized ATS's own JSON API
when the redirect lands there (and reports the resolved ats/slug back —
that's what feeds discover_companies.py), (2) falls back to scraping raw
HTML when it doesn't recognize the destination, (3) returns an empty
result cleanly on any failure, (4) fetch_adzuna only attempts the extra
fetch for jobs that already look like real candidates with a genuinely
thin snippet — not all ~2000 raw aggregator results, and (5) a resolved
Greenhouse/Lever match gets queued into DISCOVERED_COMPANIES for
main.py/discover_companies.py to pick up. Run with:
python -m pytest app/tests/test_aggregator_clients.py
